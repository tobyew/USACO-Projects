# USACO-projects

Hi!
This repository is full of USACO projects I've done, this is also my first repository and I'm new to Github so uploading everything took more than an hour.
All project links are on line 1 of every main.py

I'd say USACO Modern Art, (https://repl.it/@TobyWong/USACO-Modern-Art#main.py) was the hardest one out of all of these, but I enjoyed doing all of them about the same (well maybe Modern Art was a bit more frusturating)

I used repl to code all of these, and repl gets some stuff mixed up sometimes so I hope I uploaded everything correctly


NOTE: I'm not sure how to see a file's extended discription, but sometimes I put some info there, usually just a link to the question
